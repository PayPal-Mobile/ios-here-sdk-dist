 *
 * @param originalRequest The request as originally passed to your network delegate. If you
 *      "rewrite" the request, you need to keep the old one around to properly inform us of

 * @param currentStep The 1-based index of the step currently executing (e.g. it doesn't make
 *      sense to be on the 0th step.
 * @param totalSteps The count of the total number of steps required to execute the request.
